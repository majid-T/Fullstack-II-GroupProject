			<h2> What is CodexArma? </h2>
			CodexArma is a permissioned, closed blockchain that aims to improve firearms accountability.
			<br>
			There are two major functions of CodexARMA:
			<ul>
				<li> Tracking guns throughout their lifecycle</li>
				<li>Providing a platform to record B2C and C2C firearm transactions</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Why is it needed?</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most pressing matters confounding lawmakers in the United States today is
				gun violence. In fact, the United States stands out among high-income countries for its
				abnormally high gun violence rates. Since 2001, firearms have been used to commit between
				67% and 78% of the total documented homicides each year[1]
				. The consistent nature of these
				alarmingly high rates indicates a regular supply of firearms to the criminal class. Considering the
				stringent laws that govern weapons manufacturing and sales in the country, this should not be the
				case. How then, do guns fall into the wrong hands?
			</p>
			<p>
				According to a 2017 estimate, nearly 22% of Americans obtained their firearms without a
				background check[2]. The majority of these transactions were conducted in an informal setting
				without the involvement of a federally-licensed firearms dealer, such as from a friend, family
				member, flea market, pawn shop etc. Another problem is the presence of “straw purchasers”,
				that is, people who buy guns on behalf of other people. In fact, the majority of incarcerated
				criminals involved in gun violence that responded to a recent survey admitted to obtaining the
				gun that they used through such channels, thus avoiding scrutiny[3].
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the background checks that occur prior to a legal transaction, they can best be
				described as superficial. After the buyer fills out a form with the necessary information, the
				vendor contacts the FBI, where the information of the person is run through the NICS (National
				Instant Criminal Background Check System) database, and the buyer’s eligibility is verified
				within the timespan of a commercial break. However, the NICS is not comprehensive. Out of the
				50 states, only 12 reported having more than 80% of ineligible persons’ data present on the
				database[4].
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, NICS is far from secure. “....This type of database structure has a low fault
				tolerance in that it presents a single point of attack for a hacker and a single point for human
				errors in data entry and management. The imperfect nature of the NICS is even recognized by
				the FBI, which reports that about 3000 people pass the NICS background check every year, in
				spite of being prohibited from buying a gun by state or federal law….” mentions Professor
				Thomas Heston of Washington State University in a 2017 publication[5].
			</p>
			From the given data, two potential sources of improvement become apparent:
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing a system for tracking the complete lifecycle of a gun.</li>
				<li> Automating NICS background check system and making background checks more
				comprehensive.</li>
			</ul>
